<h1 id="scratch---loops">Scratch - Loops</h1>
<p><strong>Objective:</strong> After discussing the norms of the DLP classroom and taking care of logistical business, this lesson introduces students to their first programming environment, MIT’s Scratch. Students will learn about loops and the importance of precision for computer programming. Students will leave feeling comfortable exploring Scratch on their own.</p>

<p>Teachers should familiarize themselves with the online Scratch interface. Scratch has evolved considerably in the past few years, so a review of the latest features is highly encouraged. Teachers should also select a few Scratch demonstrations, either from their personal collection, or from Scratch’s online collection at scratch.mit.edu.</p>

<p>Recommended demonstrations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/15340566/?fromexplore=true</li>
  <li>http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/10128368/</li>
  <li>http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/13701368/?fromexplore=true</li>
  <li>http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/10128067/</li>

</ul>

<p>Note: Try to include demos that are not gender-specific or include a balance. Use your best judgement.</p>
