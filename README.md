## Contributing
If you want to edit this repo, follow the following steps:

1. Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/DigitalLiteracyProject/curricula.git`
2. Make sure you have all of the Jekyll dependencies installed (Ruby, Bundler)
3. Run `bundle install`
4. To run the server, run `jekyll serve --watch` and view the site at `http://localhost:4000`. Running this command with the `--watch` flag makes Jekyll automatically recompile the site files whenever a change is made. Makes editing and testing easy!
5. All of our lesson plans are standard markdown files stored in the `/lessons` folder. Please look at the format of an existing file in that folder to ensure that your new lesson plan adheres to the correct metadata formatting.


## Adding Content
After you set up the repo on your computer with the instructions above, you can add/edit content in the `lessons` folder. Each item must be in `markdown` format, have the `.md` extension, and have `title`, `layout`, `type`, and `order` variables set in the frontmatter for everything to be rendered correctly.
